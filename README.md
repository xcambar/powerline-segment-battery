# A battey segment for Powerline

## Limitations

* Works only on OSX. Tested on Mountain Lion only. _You tell me._

##Installation

    pip install -U --user git+https://github.com/xcambar/powerline-segment-battery.git

And then add this to your prefered spot under `segments`:

    {
        "module": "xcambar.segment.battery",
        "name": "battery"
    },

## Acknowledgements

Thanks to @Lokaltog for Powerline. I only start to see the possibilities of your project!

Thanks also to @omega for his demo of a custom Poserline segment. It would have tough
(if even possible) without this example.
